# Lostman
Lostman is an open source API explorer that uncovers abandonded APIs that could potentially be useful, or straight up space junk.
<br /><br />

## HOW, WHAT, AND WHY.
We're going to talk about how **Lostman** started, what is **Lostman**, and finally, Why did it come to life.
<br /><br />
## 1- The HOW.
**Lostman** started as a mere joke in the workplace after I had mistyped "Postman" in the start menu as an attempt to find it, wrote "Lostman" instead, and from there we started calling Postman the **Lostman**. 
Days went by, and I had decided to take the joke a step further, and so I recreated the Postman logo into a logo fit for **Lostman**, the astornaut questioning reality was generated with the help of [DALLÂ·E mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini)

<br /><br />
## 2- The WHAT.
We started poking fun of the logo and how the joke started to become a thing. and I asked myself the question, what if **Lostman** was an actual application that wanders through abandoned APIs. Like some kind of api explorer that uncovers the mysteries of the internet. It sounded cool on paper, and so I decided to start the project.

<br /><br />

## 3- The WHY.
The internet is astronomical. and our astronaut isn't afraid to explore it. the **Lostman** wanders the internet to find APIs.<br />
But why you ask? Well there's isn't a specific reason really, it's fun to see what cool APIs are out there. some could potetinally be useful, some sad, some happy, some fun, and some absoultely useless, you're abanonded in space, you can't make demands, **find a place to land on quick!**
